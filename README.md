# Developer Lander

> Project 2

<table>

  A landing page designed using pure HTML & CSS.

</table>

### Skills Gained from this

- Learned about CSS Positioning, Relative, Absolute. Also `position: fixed;`.
- Explored `display: flex;` to new heights and applied it practically while nesting it.
- Learned about :not pseudo selector and used it in the Footer to not select the first child and select the rest.
- Just to mention `flex-wrap: wrap;` can be a life savor at times. Although I have not written any media queries the text content wraps pretty nicely due to `flex-wrap: wrap;`. By default it is set to `flex-wrap: no-wrap;`.

```css
  footer:not(:first-child) {
    cursor: pointer;
  }
```
